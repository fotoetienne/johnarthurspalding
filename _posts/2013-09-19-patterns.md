Reason I know the King is here  
Molecules bow and nebulae fear  
Before dawn breaks, I bend the knee  
I cry to Truth who came before me.  

Pain longs for Heaven's health  
Tiredness, the coming might  
Poverty promises ancient wealth  
Evil proves its victims right.  

Grief, harbinger to joy's first breath  
Reverse the curse! Trample on death!  
Blackest darkness, there till morning,  
Lies bring incense, truth adorning.  

The wind through which He runs the candle  
Sight seeks faith, the Church its learning  
The foils through which he speeds the lumen  
Patterns all that bend to light.  
O bend as well your knee to Light.
