title: A Soldier Wounded in the Back

My soul is torn right in the back  
My wound has been dressed lightly.  
I have been stabbed, in the back,  
Then bandaged very tightly.  
The problem is, I cannot reach  
That far into my soul to take  
The jagged dagger out. I need  
Another to reach inside  
To touch me where I bleed.

One I trust, Who's ready there  
Weeping, angry for the loss:  
"This is different! It's different," He says,  
"than when I burned away your dross!  
A saboteur has done this!  
An enemy has dared to touch  
The apple of my eye!  
He was not a kindred spirit  
Who kissed your soul, to die.

"A deeper magic still, than this, can cause  
The tissue of your soul to live.  
You must forgive! From now on, you will wield  
This sword of Hope in right hand,  
And carry sacred Oil that seals  
The wounds of saints who've been betrayed,  
The efficacy of which depends  
On One, kissed by friends, left to die,  
His soul torn in the back."
