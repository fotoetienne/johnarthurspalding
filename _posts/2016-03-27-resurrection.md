    "So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples."
    ~Matthew 28:8, NIV.

The resurrection didn't happen in a corner somewhere. It was public. And the unlikely were the first to bear the good news, 'afraid yet filled with joy.'

It all sounds like time-and-space history to me. And it appears that our faith is not in vain after all.
