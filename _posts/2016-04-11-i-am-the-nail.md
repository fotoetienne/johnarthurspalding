title: I Am the Nail
---



Fashioned for a purpose, given as a sign,  
The King Himself gave me   
Though from Destroyer’s skill, through evil design.  
Yet, no weapon formed against You prospers,  
Every tongue that judges, You confute!  
So in spite of myself, though I am the nail  
That pierced You and held You up to shame,  
That wicked purpose reversed and mute,  
You have prevailed, and now I will speak;  
Your glory I’ll reveal, to the elect, again.
