Grief pushing hard on the hearts of a Few  
Body in shards, His soul hidden from view.  
Morning breaks, fresh Light appears,  
Hearts that have ached can see through their fears.  

First to the women, then to the rest  
Life-giving love beats inside the breast.  
Life! Life to My children! Life to them all!  
Life powers their graces and erases the Fall!  

That which was undone now caused to sing!  
Cold death to life again, winter to spring.  
This is the One giving hope in our strife:  
Jesus, the Resurrection, He is the Life!
