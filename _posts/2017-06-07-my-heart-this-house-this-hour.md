O Faithful Friend of my youth,  
And Righteous Guardian through the years,  
Please dwell with me in truth  
And, in love, drive out all fears.  
With Your Cross in view,   
And the life ahead in Heaven,  
I give it back, O High Tower!   
I dedicate to You now  
The life You’ve given,  
My heart, this house, this hour.
