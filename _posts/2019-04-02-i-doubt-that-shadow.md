title: 'I Doubt That Shadow'
# subtitle: ~ A prayer for our family ~
---


I felt a dark cloud full of rain. 
Hover over the place where I was born.  
In the midst of my sunny day.  
It came, cutting a swath—and then left—  
Of pelted soil beneath its storm.  
  
The thunderous cloud has since travelled East,  
And seeing how the Sun rules this domain,  
I doubt that shadow would dare return. 
To cut another path, beneath, of pain,  
Or ever to darken my soul, like that, again.
